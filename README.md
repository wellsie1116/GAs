## Genetic Algorithms ##

Just a test of some genetic algorithms.  Examples aren't that useful
applications of GAs, but do demonstrate how they work.

### Conway's Game of Life ###

lifegui.py provides a frontend to an genetic algorithm to find an initial grid
that will provide the longest living generation.
